## Problem Statement:

Often, when people participate in a poll, they don’t have just one preferred option; they may favor candidate A but also see merit in candidate B. What if we had a voting system designed to address this issue? Imagine if each person were given 10 votes to distribute among candidates according to their preferences. This could allow for a range of voting strategies, such as allocating all 10 votes to one candidate or splitting them, like giving 4 votes to one and 6 to another.

### problems with the new voting system
The voting system is intriguing and can capture the diverse preferences of voters, but it does have limitations and potential risks from bad actors. One concern arises if a bad actor manages to recruit about 40% of the voters. With such a significant bloc, it becomes nearly impossible for others to achieve a majority, especially since it's likely that the remaining participants will distribute their votes among various candidates.

### The Task
Your task is to develop a robust voting algorithm for a system where each voter receives 10 votes to distribute among candidates as they wish. The challenge is to ensure fairness while minimizing the risk of strategic voting manipulation. Build a backend with the following essential endpoints:

- Create a new voting room
- Add a new candidate
- Add a new voter
- Allow voters to cast their votes for candidates
- Check the results

Code structure , datastructure and optimization of the voting evaluation algorithm are some of the key points that we will be looking at
Our aim is to assess applicants' aptitude, innovative thinking, and their ability to comeup with new ways of solving problems, its an open ended assessment and candidate is free to innovate new ways. 

### **Deliverables**:
  - Backend APIs with required conditions (Built with Java )
  - video showing multiple API calls right from creating a poll till declaring the winner
  - Readme explaining steps of installation and features included
  - Live hosted API (optional)

**Push the source code along with a demo video of your solution into the forked github repo. Share the repo link in the google form: [https://forms.gle/5YxsWAoQ5kvgHbzJ8](https://forms.gle/5YxsWAoQ5kvgHbzJ8)**
